# DatingApplicationMVC

School assignment, spring 2020

A dating application made with MVC using C# for the application itself, with some Javascript for the API controllers. You register with profile information including name, gender, age, orientation and a picture. The information can be changed anytime through the "Edit Profile" page. Some features in the application includes writing messages on other's walls, send friend friend requests, and see who you would match with.

The match function is simple, it's based on gender and orientation. Heterosexuals match with each others and homosexuals match with each other. Due to the deadline of the project there were no time for expand the function so bisexuals only match with other bisexuals, and non-binary people only match with each other as well. That is something that could be tweaked a bit more, with also the option to match with people that is in the same age range.

The website isn't focused on mobile first, since the assignment were heavily based on the coding part. The default bootstrap template was used, with some minor CSS written by yours truly to make it look ok.
